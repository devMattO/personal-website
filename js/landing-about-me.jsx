            I am a passionate developer who enjoys building fast, responsive, and powerful websites. I have the burning desire to persevere through challenges and have my work live up to my obsessive, pixel-pushing standards.
            So why am I so drawn to programming? I think itâ€™s because I love the challenge. I want to prove myself. I want to get better.

            I have worked on pair-programming and group projects with teams that had to deliver live code within a short deadline.
            I presented one of my team's project at a State of Hawaii Hackathon (HACC) with over 350 people in attendance,
            including Governor Ige of HI and his tech team.
