            Thanks so much for checking out my web app! A few technical details: I built this in React and some other technologies used were Webpack, Sass, and Express. One random fact about me: I enjoy public speaking even though it scares the shit out of me.

            I am a passionate developer who enjoys building fast, responsive, and powerful websites. I am currently searching for a team that can help me grow as a developer while I can contribute my skills to the overall goal. I have the burning desire to persevere through these challenges and have my work live up to my obsessive, pixel-pushing standards.
            So why was I so drawn to programming? I think itâ€™s because I love the challenge. I want to prove myself. I want to get better.

            I have worked on pair-programming and group projects with teams that had to deliver live code within a short deadline.
            I presented my team's final project at a State of Hawaii Hackathon (HACC) with over 350 people in attendance.
            DevLeague was well presented and the Governor Ige of HI and his tech team where present.
